   MAPPING DATUM/ACCURACY 
-----------------------------
Horizontal Datum             : NAD83 UTM 20N
Absolute Horizontal Accuracy : *Unknown
Vertical Datum               : "Above Sea Level" from DJI Mavic GPS in exif data
Absolute Vertical Accuracy   : *Unknown
QAQC                         : Minimal 

*Note: The horizontal and vertical accuracies are estimated based on intuition.
Data was coregistered to a 2012 aerial lidar dataset using photo-identifiable 
targets throughout the scene.

   SUMMARY 
-----------------------------
Data was acquired at Divi Carina Bay Resort on two consecutive days.  The 
hotel was badly damaged from the storm, and the acquisition was performed with
the goal of generating a high resolution 3D model and capturing the stuctural
damage to the building.  Multiple nadir and oblique flights were performed in 
an effort to capture data from all sides of the building.
